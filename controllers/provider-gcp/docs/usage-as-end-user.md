# Using the GCP provider extension with Gardener as end-user

The [`core.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Shoot` resource](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) declares a few fields that are meant to contain provider-specific configuration.

In this document we are describing how this configuration looks like for GCP and provide an example `Shoot` manifest with minimal configuration that you can use to create an GCP cluster (modulo the landscape-specific information like cloud profile names, secret binding names, etc.).

## Provider secret data

Every shoot cluster references a `SecretBinding` which itself references a `Secret`, and this `Secret` contains the provider credentials of your GCP project.
This `Secret` must look as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: core-gcp
  namespace: garden-dev
type: Opaque
data:
  serviceaccount.json: base64(serviceaccount-json)
```

Please look up https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts as well.

## `InfrastructureConfig`

The infrastructure configuration mainly describes how the network layout looks like in order to create the shoot worker nodes in a later step, thus, prepares everything relevant to create VMs, load balancers, volumes, etc.

An example `InfrastructureConfig` for the GCP extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
# vpc:
#   name: my-vpc
#   cloudRouter:
#     name: my-cloudrouter
  worker: 10.250.0.0/16
# internal: 10.251.0.0/16
# cloudNAT:
#   minPortsPerVM: 2048
```

The `networks.vpc` section describes whether you want to create the shoot cluster in an already existing VPC or whether to create a new one:

* If `networks.vpc.name` is given then you have to specify the VPC name of the existing VPC that was created by other means (manually, other tooling, ...).
If you want to get a fresh VPC for the shoot then just omit the `networks.vpc` field.

* If a VPC name is not given then we will create the cloud router + NAT gateway to ensure that worker nodes don't get external IPs.

* If a VPC name is given then
  * if a cloud router name is not given we won't do anything, i.e. not creating a cloud router + NAT ourselves, resulting in worker nodes having external IPs (only for limited amount of time, end-users are asked to migrate to the following case)
  * if a cloud router name is given we re-use this one and create a dedicated NAT for the shoot, allowing worker nodes to not have external IPs.

The `networks.workers` section describes the CIDR for a subnet that is used for all shoot worker nodes, i.e., VMs which later run your applications.

The `networks.internal` section is optional and can describe a CIDR for a subnet that is used for [internal load balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/),

The `networks.cloudNAT.minPortsPerVM` is optional and is used to define the [minimum number of ports allocated to a VM for the CloudNAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview#number_of_nat_ports_and_connections)

The specified CIDR ranges must be contained in the VPC CIDR specified above, or the VPC CIDR of your already existing VPC.
You can freely choose these CIDRs and it is your responsibility to properly design the network layout to suit your needs.

Apart from the VPC and the subnets the GCP extension will also create a dedicated service account for this shoot, and firewall rules.

## `ControlPlaneConfig`

The control plane configuration mainly contains values for the GCP-specific control plane components.
Today, the only component deployed by the GCP extension is the `cloud-controller-manager`.

An example `ControlPlaneConfig` for the GCP extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlaneConfig
zone: europe-west1-b
cloudControllerManager:
  featureGates:
    CustomResourceValidation: true
```

The `zone` field tells the cloud-controller-manager in which zone it should mainly operate.
You can still create clusters in multiple availability zones, however, the cloud-controller-manager requires one "main" zone.
:warning: You always have to specify this field!

The `cloudControllerManager.featureGates` contains a map of explicitly enabled or disabled feature gates.
For production usage it's not recommend to use this field at all as you can enable alpha features or disable beta/stable features, potentially impacting the cluster stability.
If you don't want to configure anything for the `cloudControllerManager` simply omit the key in the YAML specification.
